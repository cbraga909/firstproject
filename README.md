# firstproject
The goal of this project was to use an Arduino and appropriate sensors to create an interactive toy that used sound and light and responded to user interactions. </br>
My partner and I created a "Pet Box," which requires a user to "feed" it with a button, provide it affection by petting it, which was sensed by a PIR motion sensor, and put it to sleep, which was sensed using a photoresistor. The needs were indicated with RGB LEDS, and if too many needs fell the box would throw a "tantrum" that would make random noises and make the lights flash randomly.
